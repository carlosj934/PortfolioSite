# PortfolioSite

Title: Design Doc

Introduction: This is my Portfolio Site migration to AWS.

System Overview: I currently host my portfolio website on Wix.com, but I am migrating my website to AWS using Github Actions for CI/CD, Elastic Beanstalk for deploying the website and Amazon S3 for storage. 

Design Considerations: Describe the issues that need to be addressed before creating a design solution

Assumptions and Dependencies: Describe any assumptions that may be wrong or any dependencies on other things.
General Constraints: Describe any constraints that could have an impact on the design of the software.
Goals and Guidelines: Describe any goals and guidelines for the design of the software.
Development Methods: Describe the software design method that will be used.
Architectural Strategies: Describe the strategies that will be used that will affect the system.

System Architecture: This section should provide a high-level overview of how the functionality and responsibilities of the system were partitioned and then assigned to subsystems or components.

Policies and Tactics: Describe any design policies and/or tactics that do not have sweeping architectural implications (meaning they would not significantly affect the overall organization of the system and its high-level structures).

Detailed System Design: Most components described in the System Architecture section will require a more detailed discussion. Other lower-level components and subcomponents may need to be described as well.

Glossary: An ordered list of defined terms and concepts used throughout the document.
